          Warka Water will be exhibited at the Colorado College I.D.E.A. (InterDisciplinary Experimental Arts) Hydrologic exhibit, curated by Holly Parker, from January 18 – March 5, 2016. Arturo Vittori is the Featured Artist in Residence there and will be delivering
          the keynote address at the opening event on Thursday, January 21st, and will lead a workshop to construct a Warka Water tower with those in attendance later in the week.
          <br>
          <br> The Hydrologic exhibition and events focus on artists and architects, like Vittori, who are actively changing the landscape of water availability through art and design. The projects presented, like Warka Water, combine both science and art,
          function and form, to find creative new approaches to water scarcity around the world.

          Warka Water project will be presented at the coming TedxAddis the 21th of November. This edition conference topic is “Building Bridges – Linking Knowledge”. TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. The main theme of this coming
          conference is “All or Nothing”: “The world we inhabit today is one full of challenges, opportunities and contradictions where our ability to grapple with the future is grounded in our choices. And although we are beginning to realize that life
          isn’t a grand zero sum equation, sometimes we must polarize others and wager everything we have in order to realize our full potential.”
