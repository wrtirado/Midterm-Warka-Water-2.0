            <div class="panel-body">In 2012, we visited the small isolated villages up on high plateau in the North East region of Ethiopia, where we witnessed this dramatic reality: the lack of potable water. The villagers live in a beautiful natural environment but often without
              running water, electricity, a toilet or a shower. To survive here, women and children walk everyday for miles towards shallow and unprotected ponds, where the water is often contaminated with human and animal waste, parasites, and diseases.
              It was imperative to take action and create a solution to mitigate the water shortage issue.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">The name “Warka Water” comes from the Warka Tree (Ficus Vasta), a giant wild fig tree native to Ethiopia. The tree’s fruit provides nourishment for the people and animals, and its shade is traditionally used for public gatherings and school
              classes. The Warka tree constitutes a very important part of the Ethiopian culture and ecosystem.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">The project drew inspiration from various sources. From nature, we observed and studied the Namib Beetle, Spider Web, Termite Hives, Cactus Spines to learn how natural organisms collect and retain water from its surroundings. Culturally, we
              were inspired by the social significance of the Warka tree, Ethiopian craftsmanship and basket weaving techniques as well as the traditional Mediterranean fish traps called “Nassi di Giunco’.</div>
